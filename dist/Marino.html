            <p class="justify2">However, the sad truth is that the media does not talk about them. The man in this article is like a </p>
            <p class="justify2">super hero. </p>

            <p class="justify1">Marino Morikawa is Peruvian-Japanese scientist who have cleaned a lake all by himself. When </p>
            <p class="justify2">he was a kid, he used to play near Cascajo Wetlands and fish in it. He then went to study in </p>
            <p class="justify2">Japan where he god a PhD in science. He was working at Tsukuba University when he learned </p>
            <p class="justify2">from his father that his childhood’s lake is contaminated because of the human’s greed. Birds and </p>
            <p class="justify2">fish had long abandoned the area and local authorities were losing hope of recovering the lake.</p>
            <p class="justify2">However, Marino did not give up. He knew that when the government cannot solve the problem, </p>
            <p class="justify2">he had to do something about it. He talked with the authorities of the area and promised that he </p>
            <p class="justify2">would save the lake in one year with no cost from their past.</p>
            <p class="justify1">Morikawa identified two key factors which had resulted in the extreme state of the wetland: illegal </p>
            <p class="justify2">landfills and the breeding of pigs, cattle and sheep. The former mayor of the region had also built </p>
            <p class="justify2">a drainage canal that bordered the wetland and which had leaked into it. </p>
            <p class="justify1">He took a break from school, went to a bank, got a loan and dedicated his time to fix the lake. He </p>
            <p class="justify2">came up with a unique solution. His solution attracts the contaminated particles and floats them to </p>
            <p class="justify2">the top. This is so environmentally friendly that you can eat it, because is a 100% organic. </p>
            <p class="justify1">One day he went to Cascajo Wetlands and dropped a ton of his solution using two nanotechnology </p>
            <p class="justify2">methods to remove the pollution and noxious microorganisms: the micro-nano bubbling system </p>
            <p class="justify2">and a biofilter. Everything, that he used, was made locally and was organic, because as he </p>
            <p class="justify2">says it is not needed to use expensive resource in poor area while you can make it home. After </p>
            <p class="justify2">developing this nanotechnology for 6 months, he cleaned the lake after 4 months. Because of </p>
            <p class="justify2">this, more than 40 migratory birds’ species returned to the lake and 10 fish species populated the </p>
            <p class="justify2">waters. The locals were inspired by Marino’s action and hard work and soon came to help him.</p>
            <div class="image"> <img class="photo3" src="bandf2.jpg"></div>
            <p class="justify1">When Marino was asked by a youtuber, who made a video for him, why nobody do that, he said </p>
            <p class="justify2">that this is a very expensive and very hard thing, but also said that it is not impossible. That is </p>
            <p class="justify2">why Marino is thinking big. He wants to clean Lake Titicaca, Peru’s biggest lake. He now has an</p>
            <p class="justify2">entire time, PhDs in science, millions of dollars in funding, patented technology and a noble goal</p>
            <p class="justify2">of making the world cleaner for everybody. </p>
