        <h1 class="h1">ECOncrete - the concrete that saves the world ocean</h1>
    </center>


    <p class="padding">Let me ask you a question. Which is the world’s second most consumed material? If you answered </p>
    <p class="justify2">concrete, you are right. Concrete is great for building. It is cheap and easy to make. But the sad fact is </p>
    <p class="justify2">that concrete is terrible for the ocean </p>
    <center>
        <iframe style="padding-top: 50px;" width="550" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlfIGwXJqs4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </center>
    <p class="justify1">So if you look into places where there is concrete in the water, you will see that the marine life is </p>
    <p class="justify2">suffering. The fish is no longer around, the oysters and corals are disappearing and the concrete is </p>
    <p class="justify2">lifeless for decades. </p>
    <p class="justify1">That is where Dr. Shimrit Perkol-Finkel and Dr. Ido Sella, two marine biologists, come in to solve one </p>
    <p class="justify2">of the hardest problems. They spent the majority of their lives researching, studying, diving and </p>
    <p class="justify2">learning about the oceans. After many, many years, they came up with an amazing technology. They </p>
    <p class="justify2">designed a new unique unit, built with new added materials. It is designed with tiny holes for the </p>
    <p class="justify2">small fish to live in them. It is ecofriendly and it is even stronger than normal concrete. </p>
    <center>
        <div class="image"> <img class="photo3" src="concrete.png"></div>
    </center>
    <p class="justify1">When you put this new concrete in the water for months, the most amazing thing happens! Small </p>
    <p class="justify2">fish live around it, seaweed grow on top of it, corals and oysters appear around it and marine live </p>
    <p class="justify2">thrives. And all of this brings the concrete to live. </p>
    <p class="justify1">An interesting thing is that when biology grows on the concrete it actually makes the concrete </p>
    <p class="justify2">stronger. This is called bio protection. </p>
    <center>
        <div class="image"> <img class="photo3" src="bandf.jpg"></div>
    </center>
    <p class="justify1">Lifeless oceans could turn into an amazing eco-system for humans and the animals alike. That is why </p>
    <p class="justify2">these guys are designing ports, breakwaters, seabeds and seawalls that are built with the ocean in </p>
    <p class="justify2">mind. It is not just beautiful. It is also good for the environment and for the concrete. Concrete is not </p>
    <p class="justify2">a “sexy” problem and solving it can be tough, expensive, challenging and takes decades. However, so </p>
    <p class="justify2">far, Ido and Shimrit installed their concrete in five different countries, in five different waters and the</p>
    <p class="justify2">results are amazing. They cast it and design it and it is placed in Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York </p>
    <p class="justify2">video for them, how do this new concrete bring life, Ido said that it do it by retaining water at low </p>
    <p class="justify2">tide, it creates hot-spots for biology. It is the design, the material and the composition of the surface </p>
    <p class="justify2">that makes all the difference. </p>
    <p class="justify1">When Ido and Shimrit install millions more of these concrete blocks around the oceans they will </p>
    <p class="justify2">change the world one block at a time. </p>
