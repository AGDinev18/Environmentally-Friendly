    <p class="padding">Plastic pollution is a serious problem. It is not secret by now that plastic is hurting the environment. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Every year we produce 300, 000, 000 tons of plastic and 50% of that is single use plastic as bottles. </p>
    <p class="justify2">You use it once for a few seconds, you throw it away and it stays in nature for hundreds of years, in </p>
    <p class="justify2">the forests and in the oceans causing harm for everyone. </p>

    <p class="justify1">Single use plastic is a problem. That is where Sharon comes in. She is a chemical engineer who used </p>
    <p class="justify2">to work at a plastic company until she quit to go solve the plastic problem. After years of research </p>
    <p class="justify2">and hard work she made a unique product that looks like plastic, that functions like plastic, but it is </p>
    <p class="justify2">not really plastic. Because her product is not plastic at all but it looks and feels like one. </p>
    <p class="justify1">When she was asked by a youtuber who made video about her and her invention how many </p>
    <p class="justify2">materials did she mix, she answered a lot. </p>
    <p class="justify1">When you put her product in the water, it dissolves within minutes. After you finish using it and you </p>
    <p class="justify2">throw it away it will just go back, break down and bio-degrade in nature and real plastic stays the </p>
    <p class="justify2">same! Her product is so environmentally friendly that even when it disappears in water you can still </p>
    <p class="justify2">drink it. </p>
    <center>
        <div class="image"> <img class="photo3" src="plastic.jpg"></div>
    </center>
    <p class="justify1">From this material, Sharon can make plastic for packaging, for food covering, for bottles and for </p>
    <p class="justify2">anything. When it works, it really has the potential to solve the plastic problem and make the world a </p>
    <p class="justify2">better and cleaner place. </p>
    <p class="justify1">Now Sharon has assembled a team in Israel to take over the world with her invention. She says that it </p>
    <p class="justify2">is very exciting for her to do it in her way and to know that it can really be an influence. Together </p>
    <p class="justify2">with her partner, Sharon is working every single day to make the world better for her children. </p>
