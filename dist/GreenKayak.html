    <p class="padding">Kayaking on the canals of Copenhagen or Amsterdam can be very romantic and enjoyable. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Unfortunately, these channels, as well as most of the channels in Western Europe, are contaminated. </p>
    <p class="justify2">This is a problem that the people of GreenKayak are trying to solve </p>
    <p class="justify1">GreenKayak is an environmental NGO that aims to give as many people as possible </p>
    <p class="justify2">the chance to engage with the fight against pollution. They believe that giving people </p>
    <p class="justify2">a connection to nature is the way to create lasting change. We offer volunteers free </p>
    <p class="justify2">trips in their GeenKayaks in return for collecting trash from the water and sharing </p>
    <p class="justify2">their experiences on social media with #greenkayak.</p>
    <p class="justify1">GreenKayaks hold two people. They’re stable and they’re safe – you don’t need to </p>
    <p class="justify2">have kayaked before to take one out – and they give you lifejackets and all the other </p>
    <p class="justify2">gear you need to paddle and pick up waste.</p>

    <!-- More text-->
    <p class="justify1">Since 2017, several thousand volunteers have paddled GreenKayaks in the harbors, </p>
    <p class="justify2">rivers and lakes of 5 countries across Europe, and collected almost 25 tons of trash. </p>
    <p class="justify1">They also have a mobile fleet of 10 GreenKayaks that they use to do activations and </p>
    <p class="justify2">events with schoolkids and youth groups. They share our knowledge on grassroots </p>
    <p class="justify2">engagement with institutions like the European Environmental Agency. And they are </p>
    <p class="justify2">currently working on building a global network of GreenKayaks. </p>
