            <h1 class="h1">Water Pollution - the problem of modern world</B>
            </h1>
    </center>
    <p class="justify1">Water is the most important and consumed resource on our planet. It is not secret that live on Earth </p>
    <p class="justify2">has started from the ocean. Then why we do not take care for our oceans? </p>
    <p class="justify1">Water pollution is a huge problem. Oceans, seas, rivers, lakes are highly polluted with plastic, </p>
    <p class="justify2">chemicals and live in them suffers. The National Academy of Sciences of The United States </p>
    <p class="justify2">estimated that over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Because of Global Warming, corals everywhere around the world die. </p>
    <p class="justify1">Water pollution affects us badly too. For example, oil spills from which fishes die, can be a serious </p>
    <p class="justify2">problem for the fishing industry on which many contries depends, including some developing ones. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Many people are forced to drink polluted water that cause lot of diseases. About 3,400,000 people </p>
    <p class="justify2">worldwide die from diseases caused by drinking contaminated water. Most of these people are </p>
    <p class="justify2">children. Improper of pesticides and their entry into groundwater is another example of how water </p>
    <p class="justify2">pollution has a negative effect on us. Pesticides – can damage the nervous system and cause cancer </p>
    <p class="justify2">because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain. Chlorides can cause </p>
    <p class="justify2">reproductive and endocrinal damage.</p>
    <p class="justify1">Diseases that are cause by polluted water are:</p>
    <p class="subhead">1. Traveler’s Diarrhea</p>
    <p class="justify1">This common digestive tract disorder can cause abdominal cramps and loose stools. </p>
    <p class="justify2">While this condition is usually not life-threatening, it can be unpleasant. For many </p>
    <p class="justify2">people in Africa who drink contaminated food or drink, bouts of traveler’s diarrhea are </p>
    <p class="justify2">common. In young children, this condition can cause a high fever, persistent </p>
    <p class="justify2">vomiting, bloody stools, and possibly unresponsiveness.</p>
    <p class="subhead">2. Salmonella</p>
    <p class="justify1">Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause an infection when ingested through </p>
    <p class="justify2">contaminated food or water. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal cramps, </p>
    <p class="justify2">diarrhea, headache, and sometimes vomiting and loss of appetite. These symptoms </p>
    <p class="justify2">generally last about 4 to 7 days and can be more serious in infants and older adults.</p>
    <p class="subhead">3. Cholera</p>
    <p class="justify1">Cholera is a bacterial disease that is generally spread in polluted water. This serious </p>
    <p class="justify2">condition results in an estimated 95,000 deaths each year according to the CDC. </p>
    <p class="justify2">While the infection can sometimes present with mild or no symptoms at all, about one </p>
    <p class="justify2">in 10 infected persons will experience symptoms like vomiting, leg cramps, and </p>
    <p class="justify2">profuse watery diarrhea.</p>
    <p class="subhead">4. Dysentery</p>
    <p class="justify1">Dysentery is the inflammation of the intestines and is often accompanied by bloody</p>
    <p class="justify2">diarrhea. The condition may be caused by a virus, parasite, or bacteria, often found </p>
    <p class="justify2">in contaminated water. Symptoms usually appear about 1 to 3 days following the </p>
    <p class="justify2">infection and can include cramping, diarrhea, and stomach pain.</p>
    <p class="subhead">5. Escherichia coli</p>
    <p class="justify1">Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a common type of bacteria that is found in the intestines of </p>
    <p class="justify2">healthy humans. However, there are some bad strains of the bacteria that can cause </p>
    <p class="justify2">severe symptoms if ingested, like bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Drinking water that has been polluted with human or animal feces can result in the </p>
    <p class="justify2">ingestion of dangerous strains of E. coli.</p>
    <p class="subhead">6. Hepatitis A</p>
    <p class="justify1">Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection that can be transferred through the </p>
    <p class="justify2">consumption of contaminated food or water. The most common symptoms of this </p>
    <p class="justify2">condition include fatigue, stomach pain, low appetite, nausea, and jaundice. Most </p>
    <p class="justify2">cases of hepatitis A resolve on their own within two months.</p>
    <p class="subhead">7. Hepatitis E</p>
    <p class="justify1">Hepatitis E is another type of liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus. It is often </p>
    <p class="justify2">associated with contaminated water in countries that have poor sanitation practices.</p>
    <p class="justify2">People with hepatitis E may experience fever, fatigue, nausea, jaundice, vomiting, </p>
    <p class="justify2">joint pain, and other uncomfortable symptoms</p>
    <p class="subhead">8. Parasitic Infections</p>
    <p class="justify1">Harmful parasites found in contaminated water can be ingested, causing serious </p>
    <p class="justify2">infections in the body. Parasitic infections can cause a range of unpleasant </p>
    <p class="justify2">gastrointestinal symptoms like an upset stomach and diarrhea. These infections can</p>
    <p class="justify2">also result in dehydration, weight loss, and flu-like symptoms.</p>
    <p class="subhead">9. Botulism</p>
    <p class="justify1">Botulism is a type of rare poisoning caused by a toxin known as Clostridium </p>
    <p class="justify2">botulinum. The bacteria can cause paralysis that begins in the face and spreads to </p>
    <p class="justify2">the limbs. If the condition is allowed to spread and paralyzes the muscles used for </p>
    <p class="justify2">breathing, respiratory failure can occur.</p>
    <p class="subhead">10. Typhoid Fever</p>
    <p class="justify1">Typhoid fever is a serious condition typically spread by contaminated food or water. </p>
    <p class="justify2">Symptoms include high fever, stomach pain, weakness, loss of appetite, and </p>
    <p class="justify2">headache. While rare, internal bleeding and death can occur.</p>
    <p class="subhead2">What cause water pollution? </p>
    <p class="subhead">Urbanisation</p>
    <p class="justify1">As more and more people move into cities and towns, a number of factors cause pollution:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- the physical disturbance of land due to construction of houses, industries, roads, etc.;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- chemical pollution from industries, mines, etc.;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- inadequate sewage collection and treatment;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- increase in fertilisers to grow more food. This results in an increase in nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) in </p>
    <p class="justify2">the water which causes enhanced plant growth (algal blooms). When this plant material dies and decays </p>
    <p class="justify2">the bacteria uses the oxygen in the water. This lowering of oxygen levels results in the death of other water </p>
    <p class="justify2">life that needs oxygen to survive, eg. fish, etc. This process is called eutrophication;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- litter, which causes disease and has a negative visual impact.</p>
    <p class="subhead">Deforestation</p>
    <p class="justify1">Clearing land for agriculture and urban growth often leads to water pollution. When soil is stripped of its </p>
    <p class="justify2">protective vegetation it becomes prone to soil erosion. This leads to an increase in the murkiness of the </p>
    <p class="justify2">water which can cause the following:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- it can block the gills of fish;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- bottom dwelling plants cannot photosynthesize as the sun’s rays cannot reach them; and</p>
    <p class="justify1">- there is an increase in disease as bacteria and viruses use the soil particles as a method of transportation.</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="deforest.jpeg"></div>
    <p class="subhead">Damming of Rivers</p>
    <p class="justify1">Damming of rivers can have an impact on water in the following ways:</p>
    <p class="justify1">1. Water flowing out of dams:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- has reduced suspended material as a large amount settles to the bottom of dams;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- is depleted of nutrients; and is often more saline</p>
    <p class="justify1">- There is also increased evaporation in dams, especially those with a large surface area, such as the Vaal Dam.</p>
    <p class="subhead">Destruction of Wetlands</p>
    <p class="justify1">Wetlands are nature’s way of cleaning water as well as damming water (they hold back water in summer </p>
    <p class="justify2">and release it in winter).</p>
    <p class="justify2">Destruction of wetlands:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Destroys the habitat of many birds and fish;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Removes the natural filters capable of storing and degrading many pollutants, such as phosphorus and heavy metals;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Destroys natural dams and causes flooding further downstream.</p>
    <p class="subhead">Industries</p>
    <p class="justify1">Industries produce waste that can affect the:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- pH of water (whether it is acid, neutral or alkaline);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- colour of water;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- amount of nutrients (increase in nutrients can cause eutrophication);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- temperature (increase or decrease in temperature can have an impact on temperature sensitive organisms living in the water);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- amount minerals and salts (too much can cause health problems);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- murkiness of water (can block fish gills; bottom dwelling plants cannot photosynthesize as the sun’s rays </p>
    <p class="justify2">cannot reach them; increase in disease as bacteria and viruses use the soil particles as a method of </p>
    <p class="justify2">transportation).</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="waterpo.jpg"></div>
    <p class="subhead">Mining</p>
    <p class="justify1">Mines produce waste that:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- can increase the amount of minerals and salts in the water (too much can cause health problems);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- can affect the pH of the water (whether it is acid, neutral or alkaline);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- can increase the murkiness of the water.</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="mine.jpg"></div>
    <p class="subhead">Agriculture</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Increases soil erosion due to the physical disturbance of soil and vegetation due to ploughing, </p>
    <p class="justify2">overgrazing, logging and road building. This effects the murkiness and the amount of salts </p>
    <p class="justify2">and minerals in water;</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Increases nutrients due to fertilisers and excreta, which contribute worrying amounts of nitrates and </p>
    <p class="justify2">phosphates to water supplies (this can cause eutrophication);</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Increased pesticide use.</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="field.jpg"></div>
    <p class="subhead">Energy Use</p>
    <p class="justify1">As human populations increase, more energy is required for human activities such as cooking, lighting, </p>
    <p class="justify2"> etc. The majority of our energy in South Africa comes from the burning of coal at power stations and results </p>
    <p class="justify2"> in greatly increased emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These gases are </p>
    <p class="justify2">the main cause of acid rain. Also the release of carbon dioxide, from the burning of coal,</p>
    <p class="justify2">increases global warming.</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="powerplant.jpg"></div>
    <p class="subhead">Accidental Water Pollution </p>
    <p class="justify1">Accidental water pollution can arise from many sources (such as burst pipes and tanks, major leaks, fires </p>
    <p class="justify2">and oil spills) and can cause varying degrees of damage, depending on the quantity, toxicity and </p>
    <p class="justify2">persistence of the pollutant, and the size and adaptability of the water body.</p>
    <div class="image2"> <img class="photo3" src="oil.jpg"></div>
    <p class="subhead2">Prevention</p>
    <p class="justify1">If you want to help keep our waters clean, there are many things you can do to help. </p>
    <p class="justify2">You can prevent water pollution of nearby rivers and lakes as well as groundwater </p>
    <p class="justify2">and drinking water by following some simple guidelines in your everyday life.></p>
    <p class="justify1">- Conserve water by turning off the tap when running water is not necessary. This helps </p>
    <p class="justify2">prevent water shortages and reduces the amount of contaminated water that needs </p>
    <p class="justify2">treatment.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Be careful about what you throw down your sink or toilet. Don’t throw paints, oils or other </p>
    <p class="justify2">forms of litter down the drain. Use environmentally household products, such as washing </p>
    <p class="justify2">powder, household cleaning agents and toiletries.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Take great care not to overuse pesticides and fertilisers. This will prevent runoffs of the </p>
    <p class="justify2">material into nearby water sources.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- By having more plants in your garden you are preventing fertiliser, pesticides and </p>
    <p class="justify2">contaminated water from running off into nearby water sources.</p>
    <p class="justify2">- Don’t throw litter into rivers, lakes or oceans. Help clean up any litter you see on beaches or </p>
    <p class="justify2">in rivers and lakes, make sure it is safe to collect the litter and put it in a nearby dustbin.</p>
    <p class="subhead2">Laws and conventions</p>
    <p class="justify1">There are many laws that protect the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes from </p>
    <p class="justify2">unnecessary water pollution. Each continent and country may differ in which laws </p>
    <p class="justify2">they enforce but they aim to have the same overall positive influence.</p>
    <p class="justify2">In Europe, there have been a number laws enforced to protect the surrounding ocean </p>
    <p class="justify2">from marine dumping.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- In 1989, the dumping of industrial waste was terminated in all countries in North-Western </p>
    <p class="justify2">Europe, apart from the UK. Dumping was terminated in the UK in 1993.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- In 1990, the dumping of sewage sludge was terminated in all countries in North-Western </p>
    <p class="justify2">Europe, apart from the UK. Dumping was terminated in the UK in 1998.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Guidelines have been developed and are currently being reviewed regarding the dumping of </p>
    <p class="justify2">polluted materials.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- Dumping of nuclear waste in European waters has been terminated since 1986.</p>
    <p class="justify1">There are a number of directives given in the European Union Environmental </p>
    <p class="justify2">Legislation:</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The proposed water framework directive aims to achieve a number of objectives regarding </p>
    <p class="justify2">health and environmental issues:</p>
    <p class="justify5">– Enforce sufficient drinking water provisions. </p>
    <p class="justify5">– Enforce sufficient provisions if water for other economic requirements</p>
    <p class="justify5">– Protection of the environment from water pollution.</p>
    <p class="justify5">– Provide alleviation of the adverse impacts of floods and droughts.</p>
    <p class="justify5">– The directive aims to achieve a good status for ground waters and surface waters in </p>
    <p class="justify5">Europe by the year 2010.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The urban waste water directive aims to protect surface inland waters and coastal waters </p>
    <p class="justify2">from pollution by regulating the collection and treatment of urban waste water.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The nitrate from agricultural sources directive aims to protect waters against pollution caused </p>
    <p class="justify2">by nitrates, especially nitrates from agricultural sources such as fertilisers. This will enable </p>
    <p class="justify2">marine and freshwaters to be protected from eutrophication.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The drinking water directive aims to establish strict standards regarding the quality of </p>
    <p class="justify2">drinking water. The directive provides parameters and analysis methods, these standards </p>
    <p class="justify2">must be met to ensure safe drinking water.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The surface water for drinking water abstraction directive and measurement and sampling of </p>
    <p class="justify2">surface waters directive and information exchange decision are integrated to form a </p>
    <p class="justify2">framework that deals with wate protection of all waters, not just those used by humans.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The fish water directive and shell water directive aims to protect waters from pollution that </p>
    <p class="justify2">are primarily used for fishing.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The groundwater directive aims to protect groundwater from dangerous pollutants by </p>
    <p class="justify2">controlling the direct and indirect discharges of certain substances into the groundwater.</p>
    <p class="justify1">- The bathing water directive aims to keep good standards in the quality of bathing water in </p>
    <p class="justify2">freshwater and coastal water areas.</p>
    <p class="subhead2">Agencies & Orginisations to contact</p>
    <p class="justify1">There are a number of agencies and organisations that work to prevent water </p>
    <p class="justify2">pollution and provide relevant information:</p>
